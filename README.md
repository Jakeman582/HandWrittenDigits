# HandWrittenDigits
A set of Matlab routines that train a Neural Network to recognize 20 by 20 pixel images of handwritten digits using a forward propogation algorithm and a back propogation algorithm.

The network consists of an input layer of 400 neurons and 1 bias unit, one hidden layer consisting of 25 neurons with 1 bias unit, and one output layer with 10 neurons.

In this implementation, the digit '0' is represented by the number 10 in the code.

The only files uploaded are files that needed editing to complete the programming project presented in the 4th week of Andrew Ng's Coursera course "Machine learning". These files really just represent my solutions.
