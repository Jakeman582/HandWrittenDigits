# HandWrittenDigits
A set of Matlab routines that train a Neural Network to recognize 20 by 20 pixel images of handwritten digits using a forward propogation algorithm and a back propogation algorithm.

The network consists of an input layer of 400 neurons and 1 bias unit, one hidden layer consisting of 25 neurons with 1 bias unit, and one output layer with 10 neurons.

In this implementation, the digit '0' is represented by the number 10 in the code.
